      <p>
        Human Trafficking- a crime of exploitation of someone for the purposes
        of compelled labor or a commercial sex act.

      </p>
      <p>There are two types of Trafficking-</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sex Trafficking: modern-day slavery where individuals perform
          commercial sex through the use of force, fraud, or coercion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Labor Trafficking: modern-day slavery where individuals perform labor
          or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the state of Utah, the law clearly defines a human trafficking victim
        as any minor under the age of 18 used in a commercial sex act without
        regard to use of force, fraud, or coercion, aligning to the federal
        trafficking law. This means that any minor used in a commercial sex act
        is a human trafficking victim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Human Trafficking is often a hidden crime as many victims feel afraid to
        come forward because of threats, manipulation, or lack of proper
        documents.
        There is not one underlying feature of Human Traffickers. Traffickers
        can be from any age, gender, nationality, occupation, or any other
        group. Human Traffickers often leverage victims vulnerabilities or use coercion to keep their victims trapped.
        Victims of human trafficking can also be from any group. No one is
        immune. Though certain groups are at greater risk. Some factors that make one at greater risk are-
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poverty </li>
        <li>Homelessness
        <li>Substance Use
        <li>History of sexual abuse/assault
        <li>Child abuse/neglect
        <li>Runaway
        <li>Juvenile Justice or Foster Care
        <li>Mental health problems
        <li>LGBTQ+
        <li>Domestic violence
        <li>Displaced persons (refugee/immigrant)
      </ul>
